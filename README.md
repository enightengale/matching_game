# Matching Game
 Your classic memory card game brought to you online!
## What I Learned 
 In this project I learned how to dynamically create elements, add classes to them, and attach event listeners that would also trigger animations! I also learned how to keep track of my clicks in an array so that I could use the data to determine most of the games functionality. But most of all I definitely learned to draw out your ideas before diving head first! This project benefited me with the knowledge to think about what the consequences are going to be if i write this code.
